"# WebsiteWithImageGalery" 


put your images in Portfolio folder.
Well, naming isn't coincidence. It was supposed to be my portfolio website, but I dumped that idea, because I'm not really good in design.
By the way, I had two visions of final version of galery :
1. Images of my other projects, clickable, when you click, div on about 90vh and 90vw appears , and inside is working project
2. Iframes rather than images
